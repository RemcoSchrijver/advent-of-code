# Advent of Code repository

My personal git repository tracking my solutions for Advent of Code, each year 
contains its own folder and dependencies are installed using nix.
The dependencies can be loaded using 
[nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) automatically 
(flake support is required).

I chose Scala for 2023 because I wanted to brush up on my functional programming skills.

## 2022

This one is done retroactively whenever I feel like it, because this was around 2023 this one is also in Scala.
