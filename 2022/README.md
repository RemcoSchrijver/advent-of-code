# Advent of Code 2022

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/stars%20‚≠ê-4-yellow)

This advent of code I am doing retroactively right now in Scala using the template from [year 2022](https://github.com/scalacenter/scala-advent-of-code/tree/main/2022).
To run a solution use the following command: `scala-cli 2022 -M dayXX.partX`
