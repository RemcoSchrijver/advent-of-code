# Advent of Code 2025

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/stars%20⭐-4-yellow)

This advent of code I did in Java.
To run a solution use the following command: `java src/dayXX.java partX` 
Inputs can be stored in the `./input/` directory, test data in `./tests/`.
If you want to run with the test data you can append the `--test` flag at the end of the command.
